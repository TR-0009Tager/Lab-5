# Lab 5: Bouncy Ball

## Overview

This lab generates a bouncing ball with an initially
random radius (between 5 and 20) that bounces around
the screen within the box, like a screensaver.

## Compiling and Using

This code requires no additional compiling requirements.

## Discussion

The lab was initially difficult because I could make it
bounce off of the top and right sides, but if it hit the
bottom or left sides before that, it would not bounce. I
fixed this by chaning some variables, and mainly by creating
boolean variables that tracked which direction it was moving.

I also had trouble changing the color of the ball, though that
was solved by simply changing a few of the constants.

## Testing

To test this, I had to run it a lot. I just had to test if there
were any cases where the ball would not bounce, or if it would
bounce in a way I didn't want it to.

## Extra Credit

I added the changing color of the ball, as well as removing the
background to show all of the balls that were created.
